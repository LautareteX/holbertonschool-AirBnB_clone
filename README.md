# holbertonschool-AirBnB_clone

Description:

This project is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration.

**What’s a command interpreter?**
Do you remember the Shell? It’s exactly the same but limited to a specific use-case. In our case, we want to be able to manage the objects of our project:

Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
Update attributes of an object
Destroy an object

**The Cmd class provides a simple framework for writing line-oriented command interpreters. These are often useful for test harnesses, administrative tools, and prototypes that will later be wrapped in a more sophisticated interface.**

A Cmd instance or subclass instance is a line-oriented interpreter framework. There is no good reason to instantiate Cmd itself; rather, it’s useful as a superclass of an interpreter class you define yourself in order to inherit Cmd‘s methods and encapsulate action methods.

A command interpreter, often referred to as a command-line interpreter or shell, is a program that allows users to interact with an operating system or execute commands by typing text-based commands. It interprets the commands and translates them into instructions that the operating system can understand and execute. Command interpreters are commonly found in various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and various Unix-like systems.

**How to use it**

Using a command interpreter, such as the Command Prompt in Windows or a Unix-like shell in Linux or macOS, involves entering text-based commands to perform various tasks and interact with the operating system. Here's a basic guide on how to use a command interpreter:

'''1. Opening the Command Interpreter:

As mentioned earlier, you can open the Command Prompt in Windows using methods like the Start Menu, Run dialog, or Task Manager. In Linux and macOS, you can usually open the terminal by searching for "Terminal" or "Console" in the applications menu.
2. Understanding the Prompt:

When you open the command interpreter, you'll see a command prompt, which typically consists of text followed by a cursor. This prompt indicates that the system is ready to accept your commands.
3. Typing Commands:

To use the command interpreter, simply type commands and press Enter. Commands are usually a single word or a combination of words, and they are not case-sensitive in most cases. For example, in the Command Prompt, you can type "dir" to list the files and directories in the current folder.
4. Navigating the File System:

You can navigate the file system using commands like:
cd (Change Directory): Use this command to change your current directory.
dir (Directory): Lists the files and directories in the current directory (or specify a path).
mkdir (Make Directory): Creates a new directory.
rmdir or rm (Remove Directory): Deletes a directory.
5. Running Programs and Scripts:

You can run programs and scripts by typing their names. For example, to run a program called "myprogram.exe," you would simply type "myprogram" and press Enter. For scripts, you might need to specify the script interpreter if it's not executable. For example, in a Linux shell, you might run a Python script with python myscript.py.
6. Passing Arguments:

Many commands allow you to pass arguments or options to modify their behavior. These arguments are usually specified after the command name, separated by spaces. For example, dir /w lists the files in wide format.
7. Redirecting Output:

You can redirect the output of a command to a file using operators like > (output to file) or >> (append to file). For example, dir > directory.txt will save the directory listing to a file called "directory.txt."
8. Using Pipes:

You can use the pipe symbol | to pass the output of one command as the input to another. This is useful for chaining commands. For example, dir | find "txt" will list files containing "txt" in their names.
9. Help and Documentation:

To get help with a command, you can often use the /? flag or --help flag. For example, command /? or command --help will display information about the command and its usage.
10. Exiting the Interpreter:

To exit the command interpreter, you can usually type the exit command or use keyboard shortcuts like Ctrl + D or Ctrl + Z.
The specific commands and their syntax may vary between different command interpreters, so it's important to consult the documentation or use built-in help features for the interpreter you are using. Additionally, keep in mind that advanced usage of command interpreters may involve scripting and more complex operations, so learning the basics is just the beginning.
'''

**Navigating the File System**

Change to a specific directory:
'''
cd C:\Users
'''
List files and directories in the current folder:
'''
dir
'''
Create a new directory:
'''
mkdir MyNewFolder
'''
**Running Programs and Scripts**

Run a program (e.g., Notepad):
